# VLMI_SwinTransformer_Context-Aware-Human-Behavior-Recognition
This paper presents the VLMI framework to detect activities in complex videos. It combines Swin Transformer video features with language prompts and an EIoU-based similarity measure, enabling accurate, query-driven activity detection and timestamping, handling visual noise and temporal uncertainty without full manual labeling.
